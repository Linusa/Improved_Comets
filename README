This was an improved version of the Comets game that I made. I added lives, levels,
scores, and shapes. Every level, more Comets spawn. Also, small Comets only have a chance
to be destroyed by each shot, and larger comets take more shots. The fire rate is slowed
significantly. The ship and comets have much more interesting shapes. The game will save
a file containing the 5 highest scores and let players enter their name if they get onto
the scoreboard. The file will be initialized with presets.
